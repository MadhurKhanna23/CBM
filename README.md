# Consumer Behaviour Marketing using A/B testing
An A/B testing campaign on Piquant Cloud Kitchen's Instagram ads in Vizag, India, aimed to optimize messaging for their meal box subscriptions. Targeting busy professionals seeking convenient and healthy meals, the campaign compared two approaches: an emotional appeal ("Miss mom's food? Delivering Now") and one emphasizing utilitarian benefits ("Easy orders Wholesome meals"). The results favored the utilitarian message, demonstrating significant improvement in key metrics: link clicks (18.7% increase), brand awareness (12.8% increase), and user engagement (21% increase). This suggests that Piquant's future Instagram marketing strategy could benefit from a shift towards messaging that highlights both convenience and health aspects of their meal boxes.
